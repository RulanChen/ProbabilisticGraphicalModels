Coding projects from my PGM class @ UMass Amherst

### Assignments

####Assignment 1 (BayesNets)

* Build a Bayesian network for heart disease prediction according to the random variables and dependencies in the given illustration
* Calculate the conditional probability tables for each variable given training data
* Perform marginal and MAP queries on the calculated conditional probability distribution of single variables given a configuration of the other random variables 
  in the graph which possibly contain unobserved variables other than the query variable
* Find the mean and standard deviation of MAP query accuracy on the heart disease variable for five pairs of training and testing data sets.
